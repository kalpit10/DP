DP ON GRIDS (P.T.R)

1. If we have a fixed starting point and a variable ending point, we start the question from the starting point not the end.
2. The Base case in Recursion is always considered using the destination (where we have to reach)
3. Base cases are generally of two types i)Destination, ii) Out of Bounds. Write Out of Bounds First

RULES FOR SOLVING RECURSION:-
If we have the problem in which we have to count all possible ways, use recursion

1. Express everything in terms of index
2. Explore all paths
3. Sum/Min/Max Take it out.

RULES FOR TABULATION:-

1. Write Base Case
2. Write the changing parameters
3. Copy the recurrence.

Note:- If in the question it is mentioned that you can take infinite supply/ multiple use of that thing. When you consider take option always stand at the same index, dont do (ind - 1) for that.
